# mystcraftLoc

Scripts to import/export Mystcraft loc files to spreadsheets for ease of handling.

It needs xlsxwriter to generate the spreadsheet and openpyxl to read the spreadsheet so that it can be returend to the
txt files.

My next step is to unify both scripts so they run off a single module.

Then I'd like to make a it an exe so that peolpe don't have to install Python and any dependencies just to run a quick script.
